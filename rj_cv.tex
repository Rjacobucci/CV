\item \textbf{Research Assistant} {Fall 2014-Present }\\
Supervisor: Dr. Elizabeth Zelinski, USC\\ 
I am currently using both structural equation models and statistical learning methods to compare the Long Beach Longitudinal Study to the Health and Retirement Study. Some of the main analyses include using the sample weights in HRS to create sample weights in LBLS as well as using SEM to model cognitive decline in LBLS. My main focus is on evaluating different methods of creating sample weights can make the results of a convenience sample, LBLS, more generalizable and to what degree.

%
\item \textbf{Research Assistant} {Fall 2013-Present }\\
Supervisor: Dr. John J. McArdle, USC\\ 
In working with data from Project TALENT (PT), I have conducted both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses in R and MPlus to determine the factor structure of 60+ cognitive variables. Using these models, in addition to 2000+ other variables collected in the initial and follow up samples, I have used the semtree package to determine relationship between these covariates and factor model parameters. Because of the complexity of models and size of sample, I have utilized the Center for High-Performance Computing and Communication's (HPCC) supercomputer. Finally, I have used multiple item response theory(IRT) models on item level data from 20 cognitive ability scales to determine the best model.
%
\item \textbf{Psychometric Expert} {Summer 2013-Spring 2014}
Supervisor: Dr. John J. McArdle, USC\\ 
Worked closely with Dr. Jiu-Chiuan Chen and Dr. Yong Cen through the Preventative Medicine department at USC in the modeling and prediction of cognitive decline in two large longitudinal datasets. Responsibilities include using structural equation modeling (SEM) to construct models to predict Alzheimer's disease, item response theory and factor analysis to evaluate the factor structure and precision of multiple cognitive measures, and Monte Carlo simulation to conduct multiple power analyses for grant preparation. I have also built on this work in conducting first and second-order latent growth models, mixture models, among other multivariate techniques.

Supervisor: Dr. John E. Williams, UNI\\
Conducted group administration of self-report measures of personality and academic achievement in a college sample. Responsibilities included the administration of self-report measures to high school and college populations, entering, cleaning, and analyzing data in SPSS, and writing up in APA style manuscript.
